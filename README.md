# Prework Study Guide
## Description

- This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- My motivation for making this product was that I wanted to see what I could on my own from following the guide and figure out my limits since this is my first time doing a project involving web development. 
- I built this project as a way to prove to myself that I can be successful in this field of work, and ease any sort of self-doubt which is due to a lack of understanding.
- I hope it would give bootcamp students a place to learn course material, even if its only a little, and this would help me understand the process that goes into web development. 
- I learned how frustrating coding or web development can be due to me not understanding the material yet, and there are no shortcuts in learning this material.
